# SlicedPy

SlicedPy (pronounced "Sliced Pie") takes your whole-house meter
readings and estimates the energy consumed by your individual
appliances.  This process is sometimes called "nonintrusive load
monitoring (NILM)", "nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM)"
or "smart meter disaggregation".

# Requirements

* Whole-house power meter readings sampled once every 10 seconds or faster.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Power Data Analysis (PDA)
   toolkit](https://github.com/JackKelly/pda/)
